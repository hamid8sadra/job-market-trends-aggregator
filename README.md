# Job Market Trends Aggregator

A Python-based tool designed to scrape, aggregate, and analyze job market trends from online sources. Built with `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`, `Pandas`, and other libraries, this project showcases advanced web scraping, data processing, and analysis skills tailored for real-world applications.

## Purpose
As a Python developer, I created this project to demonstrate my web scraping and data collection—skills critical for data-driven decision-making. The tool extracts job postings from `jobvision.ir`, a Persian-language job board, processes multilingual data, and generates actionable insights, such as trending skills or regional demand.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core language for scripting and logic.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For parsing static HTML content.
- **Selenium**: For handling dynamic, JavaScript-heavy websites.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Git**: Version control for collaboration and tracking.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <https://github.com/hamid8sadra/job-market-trends-aggregator.git>`
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate it: `source venv/bin/activate` (Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`)
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Install a WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver) for Selenium—details in Step 2.
